<p align="center">Take your synthon-based ligand discovery to infinity and beyond !</p><br />

SATELLiTES is an open-source software designed to facilitate chemical space exploration and aid in the discovery of new hit compounds, starting from a specific two-reagents or three-components chemical reaction encoded in SMARTS format and a list of commercially available or ready-to-use compatible synthons. SATELLiTES is based on the hierarchical combinatorial approaches of synthon-based drug discovery, that can enable the fast exploration of ultra-large chemical libraries.

You can use SATELLiTES in two different ways:
- By using the graphical interface, downloadable from the Python Package Index (https://pypi.org/project/SATELLiTES-SBDD/)
- By using the KNIME extension, downloadable from the extension manager (WIP)
